## Overview
In the United States, lung cancer strikes 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs. Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.

One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years.

In 2017, the Data Science Bowl will be a critical milestone in support of the Cancer Moonshot by convening the data science and medical communities to develop lung cancer detection algorithms.

Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.

This year, the Data Science Bowl will award $1 million in prizes to those who observe the right patterns, ask the right questions, and in turn, create unprecedented impact around cancer screening care and prevention. The funds for the prize purse will be provided by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation
